        <h1>EveBloggers.com is returning</h1>
        <p>Exactly which form it is returning in is still being pondered, but it's most likely going to be a list of blogs, with a few of each of their most recent posts showing. Just as soon as I work out how to get that displaying right, and updating automatically</p>
        <p>To get an idea of what people are wanting <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/PB885PL">could you answer some questions for me?</a>
